Text
====
Introduction
------------
Text allows you quickly write and read plain UTF-8 text. It attempts to follow the same principles as ``System.IO.File.WriteAllText`` whiles also working on all platforms.

You can also use Text to write formatted strings to text files or read formatted strings from text files (at the end of the day, it's just a string right?). Both `Json <json.rst>`__ and `Yaml <yaml.rst>`__ use Text for the I/O operations.

Saving strings to text files
----------------------------
**Synchronous Example:**

To save a string to a text file use ``Text.Write(string fileLocation, string content)``. This writes the string to a file at the given ``fileLocation``.

::

    public class GameSaver : MonoBehaviour
    {
        string path = Path.Combine(Application.persistentDataPath, "save.data");

        void Start()
        {
            string playerName = "James";

            // Writes the 'playerName' string to a text file at 'path'.
            Polaris.IO.Text.Write(path, playerName);
  
            // Contents of the save.data file.
            // James
        }
    }

**Asynchronous Example:**

Alternatively, you can asynchronously save a string to a text file by using ``Text.WriteAsync(string fileLocation, string content)``. This is more suitable for larger files or files on a network as it doesn't block the main thread.

::

    using Polaris.IO;

    public class GameSaver : MonoBehaviour
    {
        string path = Path.Combine(Application.persistentDataPath, "save.data");

        async void Start()
        {
            string playerName = "James";

            // Asynchronously writes the 'playerName' string to a text file at 'path'.
            await Text.WriteAsync(path, playerName);
        }
    }

Creating strings from text files
--------------------------------
**Synchronous Example:**

To create a string from a text file use ``Text.Read(string fileLocation)``. This reads the text from the file at the given ``fileLocation`` as a string and returns it.

::

    public class GameSaver : MonoBehaviour
    {
        string path = Path.Combine(Application.persistentDataPath, "save.data");

        void Start()
        {
            // Creates a string from the text file at 'path'.
            string playerName = Polaris.IO.Text.Read(path);
        }
    }


If a string cannot be loaded from the file at the given ``fileLocation``, an exception may be thrown or a ``string.Empty`` will be returned.

**Synchronous Try Example:**

A safer way of creating a string from a text file is to use ``Text.TryRead(string fileLocation, out string content)``. This will catch and swallow all exceptions, as well as always providing you with a ``string.Empty`` if an exception is caught. 

Unlike ``Text.Read``, which returns the string, ``Text.TryRead`` returns a boolean and uses an ``out`` parameter to provide you with the string. The return value indicates whether a string has been successfully created from the text file or not.

::

    public class GameSaver : MonoBehaviour
    {
        string path = Path.Combine(Application.persistentDataPath, "save.data");

        void Start()
        {
            // Attempts to create a string from the text file at 'path'.
            bool success = Text.TryRead(path, out var playerName);

            // If the conversion was unsuccessful, set 'playerName' to "New Player".
            if (success == false)
                playerName = "New Player";
        }
    }


**Asynchronous Example:**

Alternatively, you can asynchronously create a string from a text file by using ``Text.ReadAsync(string fileLocation)``. This is more suitable for larger files or files on a network as it doesn't block the main thread.

::

    using Polaris.IO;

    public class GameSaver : MonoBehaviour
    {
        string path = Path.Combine(Application.persistentDataPath, "save.data");

        async void Start()
        {
            // Asynchronously creates a string from the text file at 'path'.
            var playerName = await Text.ReadAsync(path);
        }
    }
